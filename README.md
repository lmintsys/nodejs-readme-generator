## Description

The aim of this project was to create a professional README file generator. The user is to answer a few questions about different sections of the README file the ywish to create, and a new README file is generated based on these answers.This application will allow users to generate a professional README file for their project. Working on this project helped me gaininng further understanding of how to create an interactive app outside the browser that communicates with the user, collects data, and writes it onto a separate file.

## Installation

To create this generator, the 8.2.4 version of the Inquirer NPM was installed.

## Usage

A user will be prompted with a series of questions. For most fields, the user may enter any input and it will be included in the correspondent section af a new README file. To choose the license, the user will be prompted with a multiple choice question where they will be able to choose any one from three different licenses or to choose "none". The badge of the chosen license will appear at the top of the README file and it will also include a link to the license.
